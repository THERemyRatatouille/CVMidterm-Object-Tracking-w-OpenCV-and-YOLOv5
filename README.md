# PracticalQ1-Object-Tracking-w-OpenCV-and-YOLOv5

## This is a Repository that contains .ipynb and .py files on the basics of Object Detection and Object Tracking in OpenCV and YOLOv5. Do note that for my YOLOv5 Model file I did not choose a specific YouTube URL to run the model on, so I commented out code that would create the Object Detection class and execute it. If you wish to run it, please type in an appropriate Youtube URL as well as an appropiate .avi file name and un-comment the last two lines of the file.

## Note: If you get a key error after doing the above steps, it's probably because the youtube-dl library is outated and didn't account for the removal of YouTube's dislike count. Simply CTRL + click on the backend_youtube_dl.py message in the error message and delete the line where the dislike count is instantiated.
